Final Project - Entity Academy

My interest in this topic was produced due to my interest in regenerative farming. There are not very many farms in close proximity to where I live. When they have become of topic in any of the City Council Meetings, it will be known. 
They are trying to get rid of the farmlands and develop it into industrial properties. There are many who are opposed to this proposition but there are also many for it due to the jobs that will be created from this project. I started looking into this topic and came across tilling. I found it extremely fascinating and a topic that not many people even know about. Tilling not only creates healthier crops for consumption, it also is better for the environment.
